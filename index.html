        <strong>Whoops!</strong> Javascript is required to use this site! Most of its functionality requires it and there's not much in the way of an alternative.<br>
        The source is <a href="https://github.com/myrtv/myrtv.github.io">available on GitHub</a> and 1:1 reflects anything that would appear on this site, live.
        <hr>
        <strong>Why would I allow Javascript for some random site somebody linked? What does it do?</strong><br>
        RTV is a video syncing site that syncs pre-recorded footage for any viewer using Javascript.<br>
        It currently supports HTML5 video playback and the YouTube API.<br>
        <br>
        Google Analytics is also used, but will likely have to be enabled separately in your script/ad/privacy blocker thus it's opt-in if you want to give me some stats.<br>
        For YouTube playback you will need to allow it through too, as the official API and video player is used.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Could you make this more visually pleasing? I'm enticed by fancier things telling me to enable Javascript.</strong><br>
        Perhaps, but I don't think it's worth spending a lot of time on something that most people won't see at all or very often.
